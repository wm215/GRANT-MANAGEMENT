# Grant Deliverables Action Plan for UCRP Front Step Replacement

*Prepared for internal use by UCRP and the grant manager (William Melendez) as of 30 Jul 2025.*

## Background

The **United Church of Rogers Park (UCRP)** has secured a **$250 000** grant from the Illinois Department of Commerce & Economic Opportunity (DCEO) to demolish and replace the church’s front steps at **1545 W Morse Ave, Chicago, IL**. The project must meet ADA accessibility standards and be completed with minimal disruption to church activities and nearby public‑transit users. UCRP has completed the major administrative prerequisites (GATA registration, SAM/UEI, ICQ, PRA and SOS good standing) and signed a grant manager agreement on **25 Jun 2025**. 

All grant‑related documents (grant application, project narrative, board list, scenario budget template and fiscal flow chart) are stored in the organization’s internal system. A review of the internal GitHub repository shows no additional files related to this project, so the work plan below does not rely on unpublished materials【203416014455703†L27-L34】. 

## Outstanding Deliverables

The grant manager agreement identifies five key deliverables that must be completed before DCEO will issue a Notice to Proceed. Each deliverable is described below with step‑by‑step actions, recommended best practices and responsible parties.

### 1. Business Enterprise Program (BEP) Compliance Memo

**Purpose:** Demonstrate compliance with Illinois’ BEP requirements for supplier diversity by documenting how UCRP will meet or exceed participation goals for minority‑, women‑, and veteran‑owned businesses.

**Action steps:**

1. **Identify relevant NIGP commodity codes.**  For a construction project like front‑step replacement, typical codes may include *913‑47 (Construction, Sidewalk and Driveway)* or *913‑45 (Construction, Pipe Culvert)*.  Confirm codes with the DCEO BEP manual and note them in the memo.
2. **Compile at least three quotes** from qualified contractors.  At least one quote should come from a certified BEP vendor.  Document each vendor’s name, contact information, quote amount and confirmation of BEP certification.
3. **Summarize evaluation criteria.**  Clearly describe how vendors were compared (e.g., price, experience with ADA compliance, BEP certification) and how the recommended contractor was selected.
4. **State BEP participation goals.**  Include specific percentages or dollar amounts the project will allocate to BEP‑certified subcontractors or suppliers.  If UCRP cannot meet the goal, provide justification and a plan to increase participation on future projects.
5. **Prepare a narrative memo** (1‑2 pages) summarizing the above points.  Attach vendor quotes, BEP certifications, and the NIGP code analysis.
6. **Submit the memo** to the grant manager and board chair for review before uploading to the DCEO portal.

### 2. Final Architectural Drawings

**Purpose:** Provide detailed construction documents needed for DCEO approval, contractor bonding, permitting and ADA compliance.

**Action steps:**

1. **Engage a licensed architect** to finalize plans showing demolition, structural details, materials (e.g., reinforced concrete with non‑slip treads), handrails, ramps and ADA signage.  Ensure drawings meet local building codes and ADA design guidelines.
2. **Include site plan and elevations** showing the relationship to adjacent sidewalk and the public‑transit stop.  Minimize disruptions by phasing construction and providing temporary pedestrian routes.
3. **Obtain sign‑off from UCRP leadership** and the selected contractor to confirm constructability and cost alignment.
4. **Convert drawings to PDF** for submission.  Ensure each sheet includes the architect’s seal and date.
5. **Upload final drawings** to the DCEO portal with the grant packet.

### 3. Environmental Clearance

**Purpose:** Obtain clearance required under state and federal environmental regulations before construction begins.  This may include review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) if federal funds are involved.

**Action steps:**

1. **Contact the DCEO environmental review officer** to confirm which forms and studies are required.  For a small renovation, a categorical exclusion is often applicable, but written confirmation is needed.
2. **Prepare a brief environmental narrative** describing the project scope, site history and absence of hazardous materials.  Provide photographs of existing conditions.
3. **Submit the environmental review request** with supporting documents.  Respond promptly to any requests for additional information.  Allow at least 30 days for DCEO review and clearance.
4. **Keep a copy of the clearance letter** in the project file; DCEO will require it before issuing a Notice to Proceed.

### 4. Contractor Selection Documentation

**Purpose:** Demonstrate that UCRP followed a fair procurement process, compared multiple bids and selected a qualified contractor.

**Action steps:**

1. **Define selection criteria** such as cost, BEP participation, relevant experience, timeline and references.
2. **Prepare a bid solicitation** and send it to at least three contractors (including BEP‑certified businesses).  Document dates and recipients.
3. **Collect written bids** and verify that each bid covers the full scope of work (demolition, replacement, ADA features, materials and temporary access).
4. **Create a bid evaluation matrix** comparing each contractor on the defined criteria.  Note any deviations or assumptions.
5. **Recommend the winning contractor** and obtain board approval.  Prepare a summary explaining the selection rationale and compliance with BEP goals.
6. **Compile the documentation** (solicitation, bids, evaluation matrix, recommendation) for inclusion in the grant packet.

### 5. Complete Submission to DCEO

Once the above deliverables are ready, the grant manager should assemble a final packet and submit it through the DCEO grantee portal.

**Action steps:**

1. **Verify all documents** are complete and signed: BEP compliance memo with attachments, final architectural drawings, environmental clearance letter, contractor selection documentation, and any updated budget forms.
2. **Review the Scenario Budget Template** to confirm that line items align with actual bids and the scope of work.  Adjust for accurate estimates and note any match contributions or contingency amounts.
3. **Submit the packet** via the DCEO portal.  Keep copies of all uploaded files for UCRP records.
4. **Confirm receipt** with DCEO points of contact (Modou Cham, Jenny Hoots, Dana Edwards) and request an estimated timeline for issuing the Notice to Proceed.

## Payment Milestones & Timeline

UCRP’s grant manager agreement includes a pay schedule:

| Milestone | Amount | Due Date | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Signing of agreement | $2 500 | 25 Jun 2025 (paid) | Paid upon signature |
| Award funding | $2 500 | Upon DCEO award | Payable when DCEO issues Notice to Proceed |
| Funding by **31 Aug 2025** | $1 000 bonus | 31 Aug 2025 | If the project is fully funded by this date |
| Funding by **30 Sep 2025** | $500 bonus | 30 Sep 2025 | Bonus if funded by this later date |

To maximize bonuses, aim to submit all deliverables **before 31 Jul 2025**.  DCEO review and environmental clearance can take several weeks, so early submission improves the chance of funding by 31 Aug 2025.  Maintain open communication with DCEO throughout the review process.
